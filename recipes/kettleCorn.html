        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The only difference between popcorn
            and kettle corn is a little bit of sugar.
            Unlike popcorn, kettle corn is cooked with
            sugar, which when heated melts and coats
            the popping kernels making them both sweet
            and salty.
        </p>
        <p>You don't need any special equipment to make
            kettle corn, just a pot or large skillet
            with a long handle and a lid. Make sure your
            pot is at least three quarts and not to heavy.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or cooking oil of your choice)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup popcorn kernels</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a large bowl on the counter to pour your popped kernel into.</li>
            <li>To a large heavy-bottomed pot (with a lid) add oil and 3 kernels of popcorn. Cover and heat over medium-high heat (medium if your stove runs hot) until you hear all 3 kernels pop.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of your popcorn and shake the pan for a few seconds to coat the kernels. Pour sugar and salt directly over the popcorn. Cover and shake for 3 seconds, rest for 3 seconds, repeat, until popcorn begins to pop steadily.</li>
            <li>Once that starts, shake pan mostly continuously, pausing occasionally to listen for breaks in popping. Once there is about a 2 second break between pops, pull from heat. Transfer popcorn immediately to your bowl.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool for a couple of minutes (sugar will be VERY hot) before eating. Keep an eye out for unpopped kernels as you eat, and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
